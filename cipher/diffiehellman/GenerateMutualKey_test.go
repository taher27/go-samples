ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=GenerateMutualKey_47263a2d29

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation
Issue: The function 'GenerateMutualKey' does not perform any validation on its input. This could lead to unexpected behavior or potential security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Implement appropriate input validation for 'prvKey' and 'shareKey'. Ensure they are within the expected range and are of the correct type.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Error Handling
Issue: The function 'GenerateMutualKey' does not handle errors. If 'modularExponentiation' function fails, it could lead to a panic in the program.
Solution: Implement appropriate error handling. The 'modularExponentiation' function should return an error along with its result which should be handled in 'GenerateMutualKey'.

Vulnerability: Undefined Variables
Issue: The variable 'primeNumber' is not defined in the function 'GenerateMutualKey'. This could lead to a panic in the program.
Solution: Ensure 'primeNumber' is defined and initialized before it is used.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Generate Mutual Key with Valid Private and Shared Keys

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function GenerateMutualKey is able to successfully generate a mutual key when provided with valid private and shared keys. The test will use known values for private and shared keys and compare the output to a known result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up known values for private and shared keys.
  Act: Invoke the GenerateMutualKey function with the prepared private and shared keys.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcome.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly computes the mutual key. This test is important as it validates the primary functionality of the GenerateMutualKey function under normal operation.

Scenario 2: Generate Mutual Key with Zero Private Key

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the GenerateMutualKey function handles the edge case when the private key is zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the private key to zero and the shared key to a known value.
  Act: Invoke the GenerateMutualKey function with the prepared private and shared keys.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcome.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly handles the edge case of a zero private key. This test is important as it verifies the GenerateMutualKey function's ability to handle edge cases and helps ensure the robustness of the function.

Scenario 3: Generate Mutual Key with Negative Private Key

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the GenerateMutualKey function handles the edge case when the private key is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the private key to a negative value and the shared key to a known value.
  Act: Invoke the GenerateMutualKey function with the prepared private and shared keys.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcome.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly handles the edge case of a negative private key. This test is important as it verifies the GenerateMutualKey function's ability to handle edge cases and helps ensure the robustness of the function.

Scenario 4: Generate Mutual Key with Max Int64 Value

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the GenerateMutualKey function handles the edge case when the private key and shared key are both the maximum int64 value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the private key and shared key to the maximum int64 value.
  Act: Invoke the GenerateMutualKey function with the prepared private and shared keys.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcome.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly handles the edge case of max int64 values. This test is important as it verifies the GenerateMutualKey function's ability to handle edge cases and helps ensure the robustness of the function.
