================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The GenerateShareKey function uses a fixed generator and prime number, reducing the randomness of the generated keys. This could lead to predictable keys and potential compromise of encrypted information.
Solution: Add a mechanism to generate or receive different generator and prime number for each key generation. This will increase the randomness and unpredictability of the keys.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The function GenerateShareKey exposes the private key (prvKey) as an argument. If this function is called in an insecure context, the private key could be exposed to potential attackers.
Solution: Ensure the private key is securely handled and never exposed. Consider redesigning the function to generate the private key within a secure context and never expose it.

Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The function GenerateShareKey uses the modularExponentiation function for key generation, which may be a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm if not implemented correctly.
Solution: Use a proven secure cryptographic algorithm for key generation. Golang provides several secure options in its crypto package.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Normal Operation Test

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the GenerateShareKey function. It will validate the function's ability to calculate the shared key correctly given a private key.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a known private key.
Act: Invoke the GenerateShareKey function with the known private key.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the shared key returned matches the expected output.

Validation:
The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly calculates the shared key. The expected result is based on the mathematical properties of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm. This test is important because it validates the core functionality of the function, which is crucial to the secure exchange of keys in the application.

Scenario 2: Edge Case Test with Zero Private Key

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check how the GenerateShareKey function handles an edge case where the input private key is zero.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a private key with a value of zero.
Act: Invoke the GenerateShareKey function with the zero private key.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the shared key returned is also zero.

Validation:
The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly handles edge cases. The expected result is based on the mathematical properties of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm where any number raised to the power of zero is one. This test is important because it validates the function's ability to handle edge cases correctly, ensuring robustness and reliability of the application.

Scenario 3: Negative Private Key Test

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check how the GenerateShareKey function handles negative input for the private key.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a private key with a negative value.
Act: Invoke the GenerateShareKey function with the negative private key.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check if the function is throwing an error or behaving unexpectedly.

Validation:
The choice of assertion is to verify that the function correctly handles invalid input. In the context of Diffie-Hellman key exchange, a negative private key doesn't make sense and should be handled appropriately by the function. The importance of this test lies in ensuring the function's robustness and its ability to handle invalid inputs.

Scenario 4: Large Private Key Test

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check how the GenerateShareKey function handles a large input for the private key.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a private key with a very large value.
Act: Invoke the GenerateShareKey function with the large private key.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function is able to handle large inputs without causing any overflow or other errors.

Validation:
The choice of assertion is to verify that the function can handle large inputs without causing any overflow or other errors. This is important in ensuring the function's robustness and its ability to handle a wide range of inputs.
