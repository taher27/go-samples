================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Inefficient memory usage
Issue: The use of append() in a loop can lead to inefficient memory usage and performance degradation, as it may cause frequent reallocations and copies of the underlying array.
Solution: Preallocate the slice with make() function: cipherText := make([]byte, len(plaintext)).

Vulnerability: Weak encryption
Issue: The XOR operation used for encryption is a very weak encryption method. It is vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks, frequency analysis, and can be easily broken with brute force.
Solution: Use a strong encryption algorithm like AES, which is available in the crypto/aes package of Go standard library.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Normal Operation with alphanumeric plaintext

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the function when the plaintext is alphanumeric.
Execution:
    Arrange: Define a byte key and an alphanumeric plaintext.
    Act: Invoke the Encrypt function with the key and plaintext.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The logic behind the expected result is that the function should return the ciphertext by XORing each byte of the plaintext with the key. This test is important to verify the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Normal Operation with special character plaintext

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the function when the plaintext includes special characters.
Execution:
    Arrange: Define a byte key and a plaintext with special characters.
    Act: Invoke the Encrypt function with the key and plaintext.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The function should handle special characters in the plaintext correctly. This test is important to verify the robustness of the function.

Scenario 3: Empty Plaintext

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when the plaintext is empty.
Execution:
    Arrange: Define a byte key and an empty plaintext.
    Act: Invoke the Encrypt function with the key and plaintext.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The function should return an empty ciphertext when the plaintext is empty. This test is important to verify the function's behavior in edge cases.

Scenario 4: Zero Key

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's behavior when the key is zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: Define a zero key and a plaintext.
    Act: Invoke the Encrypt function with the key and plaintext.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The function should return the plaintext as is when the key is zero, because XORing any value with zero gives the same value. This test is important to verify the function's behavior with different keys.

Scenario 5: Large Plaintext

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the function's performance and correctness with large plaintext.
Execution:
    Arrange: Define a byte key and a large plaintext.
    Act: Invoke the Encrypt function with the key and plaintext.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
    The function should correctly process large plaintext without any performance issues. This test is important to verify the scalability of the function.
