================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Weak Encryption
Issue: The XOR encryption method used in this code is quite weak and can be easily broken with a brute force attack.
Solution: Consider using a more secure encryption method. Golang has support for AES encryption in its standard library, which would be a much more secure choice.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Decrypting a Cipher Text with a Valid Key

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Decrypt function when provided with a valid key and a cipher text. The target scenario is the normal operation of the Decrypt function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid key and a cipher text.
  Act: Call the Decrypt function with the set up key and cipher text.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the decrypted text matches the expected plain text.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to verify the correctness of the decryption process. The expected result is obtained by manually performing the decryption operation. The test is important to ensure that the Decrypt function can correctly decrypt a cipher text with a given key.

Scenario 2: Decrypting an Empty Cipher Text

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Decrypt function when provided with an empty cipher text. The target scenario is edge case handling of the Decrypt function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid key and an empty cipher text.
  Act: Call the Decrypt function with the set up key and empty cipher text.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the decrypted text is also empty.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to verify that the Decrypt function can handle edge cases. Since there is no text to decrypt, the expected result is an empty text. The test is important to ensure that the Decrypt function does not crash or behave unexpectedly when provided with an empty cipher text.

Scenario 3: Decrypting a Cipher Text with a Zero Key

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Decrypt function when provided with a zero key. The target scenario is edge case handling of the Decrypt function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a zero key and a valid cipher text.
  Act: Call the Decrypt function with the set up zero key and cipher text.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the decrypted text matches the original cipher text.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to verify that the Decrypt function can handle edge cases. Since XOR operation with zero results in the same value, the expected result is the original cipher text. The test is important to ensure that the Decrypt function can handle cases where the key is zero.
