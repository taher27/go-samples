ROOST_METHOD_HASH=Decrypt_b93746c71b
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Decrypt_decfe7d122

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Weak encryption (Caesar cipher)
Issue: The Caesar cipher is a simple and easily broken encryption method. If used to protect sensitive data, an attacker could easily decrypt the information.
Solution: Use a strong encryption method, such as AES, which is widely accepted and has been extensively vetted for security vulnerabilities.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Decrypt with Valid Input and Key

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the Decrypt function works correctly with valid input and key. The test will cover the normal operation of the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a string to be decrypted and a valid key.
  Act: Invoke the Decrypt function with the string and the key.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the decrypted string is the expected one.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check if the function returns the expected output. This test is important to ensure the function can correctly decrypt a valid string with a valid key.

Scenario 2: Decrypt with Empty String

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the Decrypt function handles an empty string. The test will cover one of the edge cases of the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an empty string and a valid key.
  Act: Invoke the Decrypt function with the empty string and the key.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an empty string.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check if the function can handle an empty string. This test is important to ensure the function can handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Decrypt with Zero Key

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the Decrypt function handles a zero key. The test will cover one of the edge cases of the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid string and a zero key.
  Act: Invoke the Decrypt function with the string and the zero key.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns the same string.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check if the function can handle a zero key. This test is important to ensure the function can handle edge cases.

Scenario 4: Decrypt with Negative Key

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the Decrypt function handles a negative key. The test will cover one of the edge cases of the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid string and a negative key.
  Act: Invoke the Decrypt function with the string and the negative key.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check if the function can handle a negative key. This test is important to ensure the function can handle edge cases and error handling.

Scenario 5: Decrypt with Large Key

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the Decrypt function handles a large key. The test will cover one of the edge cases of the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid string and a large key.
  Act: Invoke the Decrypt function with the string and the large key.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns the expected string.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is to check if the function can handle a large key. This test is important to ensure the function can handle edge cases.
