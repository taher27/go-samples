================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The RSA decryption algorithm is implemented manually. This can lead to potential vulnerabilities due to the complexity of cryptographic algorithms and the risk of introducing subtle bugs.
Solution: Instead of manually implementing the RSA decryption, use a proven cryptographic library like 'crypto/rsa' from the Go standard library which has undergone extensive security reviews and testing.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: There's no verification of the randomness, primality or size of the privateExponent and modulus, which are critical for the security of RSA encryption.
Solution: Ensure that the 'privateExponent' and 'modulus' are sufficiently large prime numbers and are generated from a secure random number generator. You can use 'crypto/rand' for generating secure random numbers and 'crypto/rsa' for generating and validating RSA keys.

Vulnerability: CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The code does not check for potential errors when converting decryptedLetter back to rune. This might cause unexpected behavior or crash the program.
Solution: Add error handling when converting 'decryptedLetter' back to rune. Ensure the converted value is within the valid range of rune.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Decryption of Encrypted Text

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the Decrypt function. It verifies that given an encrypted text (array of runes), a private exponent, and a modulus, the function successfully decrypts the text and returns the original string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an array of encrypted runes, a private exponent, and a modulus that correspond to a known original string.
  Act: Invoke the Decrypt function with the encrypted runes, private exponent, and modulus.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the decrypted string matches the original string.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected normal operation of the Decrypt function. If the function correctly implements the RSA decryption algorithm, the decrypted string should match the original string. This test is important because it verifies the core functionality of the Decrypt function.

Scenario 2: Decryption with Invalid Private Exponent

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the Decrypt function's error handling when provided with an invalid private exponent. It verifies that the function returns an error in such cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an array of encrypted runes, an invalid private exponent, and a modulus.
  Act: Invoke the Decrypt function with the encrypted runes, invalid private exponent, and modulus.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the Decrypt function when provided with invalid inputs. If the private exponent is invalid, the function should return an error. This test is important because it checks the function's robustness and error handling.

Scenario 3: Decryption with Empty Encrypted Text

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the Decrypt function's handling of an empty encrypted text. It verifies that the function returns an empty string without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an empty array of encrypted runes, a private exponent, and a modulus.
  Act: Invoke the Decrypt function with the empty array of runes, private exponent, and modulus.
  Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the function returns an empty string without errors.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the Decrypt function when provided with an empty encrypted text. An empty input should result in an empty output. This test is important because it checks the function's handling of edge cases.
