================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The code checks for the length of the input to be exactly 2, but does not have any other checks for the input. Malformed or unexpected input could potentially cause issues.
Solution: More robust input validation could be implemented. For example, checking if the runes are valid before attempting to use them.

Vulnerability: Error Handling
Issue: The current error messages reveal too much information about the internal workings of the code. This could potentially be used by an attacker to gain insights into the system.
Solution: Make the error messages more generic. Instead of revealing which character does not exist in the characters, simply say that the input is invalid.

Vulnerability: Denial of Service
Issue: The 'strings.IndexRune' function has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the string. If the 'characters' string is very long, this could lead to performance issues and potential denial of service attacks.
Solution: Consider using a data structure with faster lookup times to store the characters, such as a map. This can reduce the time complexity of the lookup to O(1).

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Deciphering of Characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the successful deciphering of characters when provided with valid input. The characters provided exist within the characters of the Polybius instance and the length of the characters slice is even.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Polybius instance with a known set of characters and key. Provide a pair of characters that exist within the characters of the Polybius instance.
    Act: Invoke the decipher method on the Polybius instance with the pair of characters.
    Assert: Verify that the decipher method returns the expected string and no error.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the decipher method correctly identifies the characters within the Polybius instance and returns the correct string. This test is important as it validates the basic functionality of the decipher method.

Scenario 2: Input Characters Length is not Even

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the decipher method when the length of the input characters slice is not even. The method should return an error in such cases.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Polybius instance with a known set of characters and key. Provide a slice of characters with an odd length.
    Act: Invoke the decipher method on the Polybius instance with the slice of characters.
    Assert: Verify that the decipher method returns an error indicating that the size of "chars" must be even.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the decipher method correctly identifies when the length of the input characters slice is not even and returns an appropriate error. This test is important as it ensures that the decipher method enforces the requirement for an even number of characters.

Scenario 3: Input Characters Do Not Exist in Polybius Characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the decipher method when the input characters do not exist within the characters of the Polybius instance. The method should return an error in such cases.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Polybius instance with a known set of characters and key. Provide a pair of characters that do not exist within the characters of the Polybius instance.
    Act: Invoke the decipher method on the Polybius instance with the pair of characters.
    Assert: Verify that the decipher method returns an error indicating that the characters do not exist in the Polybius characters.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the decipher method correctly identifies when the input characters do not exist within the Polybius characters and returns an appropriate error. This test is important as it ensures that the decipher method correctly handles invalid input characters.

Scenario 4: Successful Deciphering with Special Characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the successful deciphering of special characters. The special characters provided exist within the characters of the Polybius instance and the length of the characters slice is even.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Polybius instance with a known set of characters and key that includes special characters. Provide a pair of special characters that exist within the characters of the Polybius instance.
    Act: Invoke the decipher method on the Polybius instance with the pair of special characters.
    Assert: Verify that the decipher method returns the expected string and no error.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the decipher method correctly identifies the special characters within the Polybius instance and returns the correct string. This test is important as it validates that the decipher method can handle special characters.
