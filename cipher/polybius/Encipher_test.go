================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The operations index / p.size and index % p.size could lead to integer overflow if the variable index is large. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Check if index is within the expected range before performing these operations. Use big integers if the size can be very large.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate if the input rune char is valid. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Validate the input rune char before using it. Return an error if it's not valid.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The function does not check if p or p.key or p.characters is nil before using them. This could lead to nil pointer dereference panic.
Solution: Check if p, p.key and p.characters are not nil before using them. Return an error if they are nil.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Encipher a character found in the key

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the "encipher" function when the input character is found in the key.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Polybius struct with a key that contains the character to be enciphered.
    Act: Call the "encipher" function with the character as the argument.
    Assert: Check that the returned string matches the expected result and that no error is returned.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies the position of the character in the key and translates it into the corresponding characters in the "characters" string. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly enciphers characters present in the key.

Scenario 2: Encipher a character not found in the key

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the error handling of the "encipher" function when the input character is not found in the key.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Polybius struct with a key that does not contain the character to be enciphered.
    Act: Call the "encipher" function with the character as the argument.
    Assert: Check that an error is returned and that the error message correctly identifies the missing character.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly handles the error case of a missing character in the key and returns an informative error message. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles error cases and provides useful feedback to the user.

Scenario 3: Encipher a character with a key of size zero

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the error handling of the "encipher" function when the key size is zero.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Polybius struct with a key size of zero.
    Act: Call the "encipher" function with any character as the argument.
    Assert: Check that an error is returned and that the error message correctly identifies the issue with the key size.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly handles the error case of a key size of zero and returns an informative error message. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles error cases and provides useful feedback to the user.

Scenario 4: Encipher a character with a key and character set of different sizes

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the error handling of the "encipher" function when the key and character set are of different sizes.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the Polybius struct with a key and character set of different sizes.
    Act: Call the "encipher" function with any character as the argument.
    Assert: Check that an error is returned and that the error message correctly identifies the issue with the key and character set sizes.
Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly handles the error case of a mismatch in the key and character set sizes and returns an informative error message. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles error cases and provides useful feedback to the user.
