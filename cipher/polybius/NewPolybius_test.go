Scenario 1: Test with valid inputs

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function "NewPolybius" works properly with valid inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare valid parameters for the function. For example, key="abcdef", size=2, chars="abcdef".
  Act: Invoke the "NewPolybius" function with these valid parameters.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes. The expected outcome is a new Polybius object with the given parameters and no error.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when valid inputs are provided. The result should be a new Polybius object with the given parameters and no error. This test is important to ensure that the function is working properly under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Test with a negative size

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function "NewPolybius" returns an error when the provided size is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare parameters with a negative size. For example, key="abcdef", size=-2, chars="abcdef".
  Act: Invoke the "NewPolybius" function with these parameters.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error as expected.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when the provided size is negative. The function should return an error in this case. This test is crucial for ensuring that the function handles invalid inputs properly.

Scenario 3: Test with a size greater than the length of chars

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function "NewPolybius" returns an error when the provided size is greater than the length of chars.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare parameters with a size greater than the length of chars. For example, key="abcdef", size=10, chars="abcdef".
  Act: Invoke the "NewPolybius" function with these parameters.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error as expected.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when the provided size is too large. The function should return an error in this scenario. This test is important for ensuring that the function is able to handle edge cases properly.

Scenario 4: Test with chars containing non-latin characters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function "NewPolybius" returns an error when chars contains non-latin characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare parameters with chars containing non-latin characters. For example, key="abcdef", size=2, chars="abc123".
  Act: Invoke the "NewPolybius" function with these parameters.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error as expected.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when chars contains non-latin characters. The function should return an error in this case. This test is crucial for ensuring that the function handles invalid inputs properly.

Scenario 5: Test with chars containing duplicate characters

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function "NewPolybius" returns an error when chars contains duplicate characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare parameters with chars containing duplicate characters. For example, key="abcdef", size=2, chars="abcabc".
  Act: Invoke the "NewPolybius" function with these parameters.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error as expected.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when chars contains duplicate characters. The function should return an error in this case. This test is crucial for ensuring that the function handles invalid inputs properly.

Scenario 6: Test with a key length that is not equal to the square of the size

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function "NewPolybius" returns an error when the length of the key is not equal to the square of the size.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare parameters with a key length that is not equal to the square of the size. For example, key="abcdef", size=3, chars="abcdef".
  Act: Invoke the "NewPolybius" function with these parameters.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error as expected.
Validation:
  The assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when the length of the key is not equal to the square of the size. The function should return an error in this case. This test is crucial for ensuring that the function handles invalid inputs properly.
