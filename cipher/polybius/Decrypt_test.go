ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Decrypt_2aa67b3256

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The code fails to check if 'i+2' exceeds the maximum value of integer before using it in a slice operation, potentially leading to an integer overflow attack.
Solution: Before performing the slice operation, ensure that 'i+2' does not exceed the maximum integer value. Use 'math.Min' function to prevent any overflow.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate the length of the input string. If an odd-length string is passed, it may lead to out-of-bound errors or unexpected results.
Solution: Add a conditional statement at the beginning of the function to check if the length of the text is an even number. If it's not, return an error message.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The 'decipher' function might be holding some resources which are not being released properly if an error is encountered.
Solution: Ensure that any resources held by 'decipher' are properly released before returning an error. This can be done using 'defer' statement or checking for an error immediately after the 'decipher' call and then releasing the resources.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Decryption

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Decrypt function when provided with valid input. It will test if the function is able to successfully decrypt a given text.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Polybius struct with a valid size, characters, and key. Also, prepare a valid encrypted text as input.
  Act: Invoke the Decrypt function with the encrypted text as the parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual decrypted text matches the expected text.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to validate the correctness of the Decrypt function. The expected result is determined based on the known behavior of the decryption process. This test is important to ensure that the application can successfully decrypt text as per the business requirements.

Scenario 2: Decryption with Empty Text

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Decrypt function when provided with an empty text. It should return an empty string without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Polybius struct with a valid size, characters, and key. Prepare an empty string as the input text.
  Act: Invoke the Decrypt function with the empty text as the parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string is empty and no error is thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to validate the behavior of the Decrypt function when handling edge cases. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle edge cases gracefully without errors.

Scenario 3: Decryption with Invalid Text

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Decrypt function when provided with invalid text. It should return an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Polybius struct with a valid size, characters, and key. Prepare an invalid text (text that cannot be decrypted) as the input.
  Act: Invoke the Decrypt function with the invalid text as the parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that an error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to validate the behavior of the Decrypt function when handling invalid input. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle invalid input gracefully and return an appropriate error message.

Scenario 4: Decryption with Null Receiver

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the Decrypt function when the receiver (Polybius struct) is null. It should return an error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a null Polybius struct and a valid encrypted text.
  Act: Invoke the Decrypt function with the encrypted text as the parameter.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that an error is returned.
Validation:
  The assertion is chosen to validate the behavior of the Decrypt function when the receiver is null. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle null receivers gracefully and return an appropriate error message.
