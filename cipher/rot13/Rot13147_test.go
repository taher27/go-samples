================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Dependency Vulnerability
Issue: The code is using an external package 'github.com/TheAlgorithms/Go/cipher/caesar'. If this package has any security vulnerabilities, it could affect your application as well.
Solution: Ensure that you are using the latest and secure version of the external package. Regularly update the package and check for any reported vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The function 'rot13' accepts a string as input but does not perform any validation on it. If the input is not properly sanitized, it could lead to security issues such as script injection or buffer overflow attacks.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize input to your functions. Use Golang's 'net/url' package's 'QueryEscape' function to sanitize the input string.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid ROT13 ciphering of a string

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the correct functionality of the rot13 function when provided with a valid string. The function should return the string ciphered with the ROT13 cipher.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a string variable with a known value.
Act: Invoke the rot13 function with the created string as an argument.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output of the function matches the expected ROT13 ciphered string.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the rot13 function correctly ciphers the input string using the ROT13 cipher. This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly implementing the ROT13 cipher.

Scenario 2: ROT13 ciphering of an empty string

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the rot13 function when provided with an empty string. The function should return an empty string.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an empty string variable.
Act: Invoke the rot13 function with the empty string as an argument.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output of the function is an empty string.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the rot13 function correctly handles the edge case of an empty string. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle edge cases and does not produce errors or unexpected results.

Scenario 3: ROT13 ciphering of a string with special characters

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the rot13 function when provided with a string containing special characters. The function should return the string with special characters unchanged.

Execution:
Arrange: Create a string variable with a known value and special characters.
Act: Invoke the rot13 function with the created string as an argument.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the output of the function matches the expected ROT13 ciphered string with special characters unchanged.

Validation:
The assertion checks if the rot13 function correctly handles strings with special characters. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly ciphers the alphabetic characters and leaves the special characters unchanged.
