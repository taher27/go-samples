================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
Issue: The 'Encrypt' function appends a placeholder to the text input without checking the size of the input. This could potentially lead to a buffer overflow if a large text input is provided.
Solution: Ensure that the size of the input is checked before appending the placeholder. Also, consider limiting the maximum size of the text input that can be processed.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate the 'keyWord' input. If an empty string or a string with non-alphanumeric characters is provided, the 'getKey' function may behave unpredictably.
Solution: Add input validation for the 'keyWord' parameter. Ensure it is not empty and only contains valid characters.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The function does not check if the 'text' input is null before accessing its length and last character. This could lead to a runtime panic if a null input is provided.
Solution: Add a null check for the 'text' parameter at the start of the function.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful Encryption
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the successful execution of the Encrypt function when provided with a valid text and keyword. It covers the normal operation of the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up valid text and keyword for the function.
  Act: Invoke the Encrypt function with the valid text and keyword.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the actual results match the expected outcomes.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected encrypted text based on the keyword. The test is important to ensure the function correctly encrypts the text with the given keyword.

Scenario 2: Encrypt Function with Empty Keyword
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the Encrypt function when the keyword is empty. It should return an error in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up valid text and an empty keyword for the function.
  Act: Invoke the Encrypt function with the valid text and empty keyword.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected error when the keyword is empty. This test is crucial to ensure the function handles the error scenario correctly.

Scenario 3: Encrypt Function with Empty Text
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the Encrypt function when the text is empty. It should return an error in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an empty text and a valid keyword for the function.
  Act: Invoke the Encrypt function with the empty text and valid keyword.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected error when the text is empty. This test is crucial to ensure the function handles the error scenario correctly.

Scenario 4: Encrypt Function with Text Ending with Placeholder
Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check the Encrypt function when the text ends with a placeholder. It should return an error in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a text ending with a placeholder and a valid keyword for the function.
  Act: Invoke the Encrypt function with the text and valid keyword.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected error when the text ends with a placeholder. This test is crucial to ensure the function handles the error scenario correctly.
