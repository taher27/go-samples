================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function getKey does not handle any errors or exceptions, which could lead to unexpected behavior if an invalid input is passed.
Solution: Implement error handling to ensure that the function behaves correctly even when it receives invalid input. For example, check if the input is empty or null before proceeding with the rest of the function.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing with a single word without any repeating characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getKey function can correctly provide the transposition key for a word without any repeating letters.
Execution:
    Arrange: The input word for this test would be "go".
    Act: Invoke the getKey function with the word "go".
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the returned key is [1, 2].
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the key returned correctly represents the transposition of the word. The importance of this test is to ensure that the function works correctly for a basic input.

Scenario 2: Testing with a single word with repeating characters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getKey function can correctly provide the transposition key for a word with repeating letters.
Execution:
    Arrange: The input word for this test would be "google".
    Act: Invoke the getKey function with the word "google".
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the returned key is [3, 1, 5, 4, 6, 2].
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the key returned correctly represents the transposition of the word, accounting for repeated characters. This test is important as it checks the function's capability to handle words with repeating characters.

Scenario 3: Testing with an empty string

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getKey function can handle an empty string input.
Execution:
    Arrange: The input word for this test would be "".
    Act: Invoke the getKey function with the empty string.
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the returned key is an empty slice [].
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly returns an empty slice when provided with an empty string. This test is important as it checks the function's capability to handle empty inputs.

Scenario 4: Testing with a single word with uppercase and lowercase letters

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the getKey function can correctly provide the transposition key for a word with both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Execution:
    Arrange: The input word for this test would be "GoLang".
    Act: Invoke the getKey function with the word "GoLang".
    Assert: Use Go's testing facilities to verify that the returned key is [2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 6].
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function correctly returns the key even when the input word has both uppercase and lowercase letters. This test is important as it checks the function's capability to handle words with mixed case letters.
